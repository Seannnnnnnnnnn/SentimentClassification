# SentimentClassification
Statistical learning project aimed at classifying the sentiment of tweets, using data sets provided generously by *The University of Melbourne*. Datasets include a raw representation of the tweet, `tf_idf` values of the tweet, and `glove 100` embeddings of the tweet.

Inspired by the comments of *Subiah*, we are interested in exploring the necessity of deep learning methods in developing robust sentiment classification models in the context of tweets. The notebooks explores model performence across a variety of datasets.
